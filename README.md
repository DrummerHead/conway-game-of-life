# Conway's Game of Life

This is my JS version of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

* Vanilla JS
* Adapts to viewport (bigger monitor, bigger board)
* Toroidal board (limits connect to itself)
* Improved experience for touch devices
* Rule agnostic (other rules could be implemented on the same board)

## Get a great program for Conway's Game of Life

I love CGF and you should get the best program for this algorithm and many more from http://golly.sourceforge.net/

Also [available for iPad!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/golly/id553184760?ls=1&mt=8)

(I'm in no way associated with the developers of these programs, it's just that they are great)
